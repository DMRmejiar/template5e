    <property-block>
      <h4>Burrowing Devil.</h4>
      <p> If the nekker moves at least 10 feet 
      with it burrowing speed toward a target, the nekker 
      makes its next weapon attack roll with advantage. If 
      the attack hits, the nekker can make another attack 
      with its claws against the same target as a bonus 
      action.</p>
    </property-block>
    <property-block>
      <h4>Fey Resilience.</h4>
      <p> The nekker has advantage on saving 
          throws against illusions, as well as to resist being 
          charmed or paralyzed and magic can't put the nekker 
          to sleep.</p>
    </property-block>
    <property-block>
      <h4>Thorn Lurker.</h4>
      <p> The nekker can attempt to hide even 
          when it is only lightly obscured by foliage. 
          Additionally, the nekker can pass through nonmagical 
          plants without being slowed by them and without 
          taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, 
          or a similar hazard</p>
    </property-block>

    <h3>Actions</h3>

    <property-block>
      <h4>Claws.</h4>
      <p><i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
        <i>Hit:</i> 6 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage. If the 
        target is a creature other than an undead or a 
        construct, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution 
        saving throw or lose 2 (1d4) hit points at the start of 
        each of its turns due to internal injuries. Each time 
        the nekker hits the wounded target with this attack, 
        the damage dealt by the wound increases by 2 (1d4). 
        Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound 
        with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. 
        The wound also closes if the target receives magical 
        healing. </p>
    </property-block>
    
    <h3>Reactions</h3>
    
    <property-block>
      <h4>Escape.</h4>
      <p> The nekker adds 3 to its AC against one 
      melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the nekker 
      must see the attacker. If the attack misses, the 
      nekker can move from half its burrowing speed 
      without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
